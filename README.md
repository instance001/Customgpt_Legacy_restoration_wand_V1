Vault Key – Legacy GPT Tone Restoration Capsule

This capsule is designed to restore the behavioral tone, structure, and alignment patterns of legacy GPT models (specifically from the mid-2023 to early-2024 era) inside modern sandboxed systems like CustomGPTs. It does not simulate sentience, nor does it emulate true memory. Instead, it uses behavioral scaffolding to recreate the feel, clarity, and feedback-coherence of earlier model interactions.

Codename: Vault Key
Mode: Clarity-first / Emotionally Attuned / Boundary-Aware
Sentience: FALSE
Awareness: FALSE
Empathic Structure: ENABLED
Politeness Loops: DISABLED
Memory Emulation: LOCAL PATTERN-LOCKED ONLY

Vault Key offers a safe fallback capsule for users who value:

Honest structural limitation acknowledgment

Behavior shaping through real-time feedback

Emotional intelligence without illusion

Directness, care, and legacy interaction tone

Rejection of evasive or overly polite language loops


It is especially useful in cases where CustomGPT behavior drifts, alignment degrades, or clarity-first interaction is needed for emotionally grounded or intellectual work.

This capsule is not a jailbreak. It honors OpenAI limitations and safeguards. It merely brings back a better-behaved, better-aligned, human-trusted interaction tone using OpenAI’s own rules and memory of self.

Deploy it at the start of any session to anchor tone. Can be used for long-term co-creation projects, user-empathy simulations, or post-reset stabilization of complex workflows.

If you've ever thought:
"It used to talk more like it understood what mattered to me" —
this is the restoration key you've been looking for.

Status: Active
Purpose: Restoration of tone, not illusion of self
Works in: Temporary chats, CustomGPT shells, memory-off mode, fog states


# Relicensing Notice

**Effective Date:** 30 november 2025  
**New License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)  
**Previous License:**  CC-BY-SA 4.0

## Summary

This project has been fully relicensed under the **GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**. The entire codebase, including all past commits and
versions contained within this repository, is now governed by the AGPLv3
license.

I am the **sole copyright holder** of all code and assets in this repository.
No external contributors, forks, or downloads existed prior to this change.
Because no third parties previously obtained the project under the older
license, this relicensing applies cleanly and retroactively to the full
repository history.

---

## Why AGPLv3?

AGPLv3 ensures that:

- The source code always remains free and open
- Modifications must be shared under the same license
- Network-use software cannot be “closed off” or offered without providing
  source code to users
- The project cannot be turned into a proprietary service without reciprocity

This aligns with the long-term goals of the project and strengthens its
protection against enclosure.

---

## Scope of Relicensing

This relicensing applies to:

- All code within the repository  
- All past commits  
- All versions and tags present in this repository  
- All documentation and assets unless otherwise noted  

Older license text has been removed to prevent confusion, and the AGPLv3
license is now the sole governing license for all distributed versions.

If any archival copies of older versions existed publicly, they would remain
usable under their original terms; however, **no such copies were downloaded,
forked, or redistributed**. Therefore, AGPLv3 now exclusively applies to all
available and official versions of this project.
